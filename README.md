Capstone Project: E-Learning Web Application

This repository contains the source code for my final capstone project at ApexPlanet Software Pvt. Ltd. I developed a fully responsive and interactive **E-Learning Web Application** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project serves as a culmination of the skills and knowledge I gained throughout my internship.

**Key Features:**

1.  **Interactive Course Pages:** User-friendly and engaging pages for different courses.
2.  **Quiz & Score Tracking System:** A dynamic quiz section to test user knowledge with a score-tracking feature.
3.  **Mock Test Functionality:** Allows users to take mock tests to prepare for exams.
4.  **Certificate Download:** Enables users to download a certificate upon completion.
5.  **Fully Responsive UI:** The application is optimized for a seamless experience on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

This project was a significant opportunity to apply my front-end development skills to a complex, real-world application, with a strong focus on both functionality and user experience.
